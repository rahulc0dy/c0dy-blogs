# ðŸš€ Building a Markdown Blog in Next.js  

Creating a blog using **Markdown** in **Next.js 15** is a great way to manage content without a database. In this post, weâ€™ll explore how we built a **Markdown-powered blog** with features like:  

- âœ… **Markdown Parsing** using `react-markdown`  
- âœ… **Front Matter Support** for metadata  
- âœ… **Syntax Highlighting** for code blocks  
- âœ… **Dark Mode Styling**  
- âœ… **Admin-Only Blog Creation**

## ðŸ“Œ 1. Storing Blogs as Markdown  

Each blog post is stored as a `.md` file inside the `/blogs` directory. Each file contains **front matter metadata** (title, date, slug) at the top, followed by the Markdown content.  

**Example Markdown file:**

```md

title: "My First Blog Post"
date: "2025-02-02"
slug: "my-first-blog-post"
